the backend: POST to URI `/slack` with appropriate payload `token=TOKEN` and `text=SEARCHSTRING`. returns the best match & phone number to the user. if the expected Slack challenge token is not sent along with the request, the request is dropped. tokens are configured as environment variables in the app.yaml. a separate Slack token is required to POST back into Slack.

1) deploy to App Engine using `goapp deploy` once you've setup goapp
2) setup your `/slash` command in Slack
3) profit
