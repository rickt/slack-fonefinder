# â˜Žfinder
backend basics: 
* you configure a slack `/slash` command to POST to URI `/slack` with appropriate payload `token=TOKEN` and `text=SEARCHSTRING`
* the best match & phone number is returned to the user
* if the expected Slack "challenge" token (get this from your `/slash` command setup) is not sent along with the request, the request is dropped
* requires a separate Slack OAuth2 bearer token (get a quickie from https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens to get going ASAP, but don't use this token permanently!!!) to establish backend connection into your Slack to retrieve user data & POST response to request into Slack
* both tokens are configured as environment variables in the app.yaml

written specifically to run in Google App Engine. should be plug-n-play for you. 

1. deploy to App Engine using `goapp deploy` once you've setup goapp
2. setup your `/slash` command in Slack
3. profit

##### notes
* this is written specifically for google app engine, hence no main() and  [github.com/rickt/slack-appengine](https://github.com/rickt/slack-appengine) requirement
* change values as appropriate in the environment variable section in your app.yaml
